            description = "Japanese group Fishmans developed a distinctive, dreamy sound rooted in reggae and dub, while also incorporating a wide range of other styles, including trip-hop, psychedelia, pop, and ambient. The band formed in the late 1980s and initially played a fairly conventional brand of rocksteady before branching out and exploring different sounds, but constant elements of the group\'s music included primary songwriter Shinji Sato\'s haunting, androgynous vocals, Kin-Ichi Motegi\'s steady yet flexible drumming and sample-based rhythms, and Yuzuru Kashiwabara\'s deep, dubby bass lines. Evolving from the group\'s reggae roots, they shifted into more of a dream pop sound with later releases such as Kuchu Camp and the experimental epic Long Season, both released in 1996. Sato\'s unexpected death from heart failure brought Fishmans\' original incarnation to an end in 1999, but the surviving members and their regular collaborators have since performed several reunion concerts and tributes. While Fishmans achieved minor commercial success in their home country during Sato\'s lifetime, they have earned a fervent cult following mainly due to word-of-mouth discussion on various online forums, and their international popularity has continued to grow exponentially."

In particular, Cornelius (aka Keigo Oyamada) had a lot to do with jump-starting Karie\'s career in music; during the early \'90s, she was a music photographer and he was her boyfriend at the time. Oyamada asked her to sing with a band on his friend\'s label, and her sweet, sensual, yet innocent vocal style was discovered. Almost immediately after the release of her first EP, Karie became a superstar in Japan, releasing several gold-status singles, hosting a radio program, and recording the theme song to one of the nation\'s most popular animated shows."

She released a total of five albums between 1978 and 1982, with a series of singles scratching the Top 100 or Top 40 of the Oricon charts, but never gaining a number one hit (though \"Mysterious Peach Pie\" did become a strong player, peaking at a number three position). The albums fared similarly, each hitting the weekly Top 20, but only 1980\'s Love Songs hit number one on the charts and became a strong seller. "
